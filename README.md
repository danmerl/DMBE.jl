DMBE.jl
=======

DMBE.jl is primarily an exercise in teaching myself a bit about Julia, and a bit about jupyter notebooks.  But I figured I might as well make this somewhat useful, and so I'm structuring this exercise as a reproduction of some of the key results from the 1989 classic "Dynamic Models In Behavioral Ecology" by Mangel and Clark.
